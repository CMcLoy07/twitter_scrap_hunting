# twitter_scrap_hunting

Twitter is a vast universie of text put out by many users. Much of that text can be taken to provide insights to marketing teams, businesses, and just general data enthusiasist. 

With that in mind, the intent of the twitter scrapping code within this notebook was to pull a data set from #hunting tweets in a 7 day time frame. The information obtained would help to answer the question, "One what day is #hunting used the most during the regualar hunting season and from what location in the World are the users?". The hypothesis set stated that the majority of tweets would be done on either a Friday or Monday, pre and post a hunting trip. 

The acquiring and analyzing of these tweets utilize the Twitter API search, Pandas Dataframe structure and bar charts of dates and areas that the users are located in. Each of these methods produced the ability to pull the data, create a dataframe and visually analyze the information for quick conclusions.
